# STATUB18--Forecasting-Time-Series-Data
A statistics course offered by NYU Stern School of Business. This course covers practical time series forecasting techniques with particular emphasis on the Box-Jenkins (ARIMA) method, and conditional volatility (ARCH) models.
I use Minitab and R for data analysis.
